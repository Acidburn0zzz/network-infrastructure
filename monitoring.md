# Monitoring metacpan

We have 3 systems for monitoring:

- http://munin.metacpan.org/ (very basic but good quick glance)

- https://github.com/metacpan/metacpan-monitoring (which is in hourly cron and sends emails)

- https://www.panopta.com/ (they give us a free account and we run their agent on our servers)
