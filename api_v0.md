# Maintaining the api/v0

We will eventually depreciate v0, but that will be long
after the move, so how do we support it.

#1 is for discussion, but please do update this doc.

What needs to happen to make our API v0 work with ElasticSearch 1.x?

- [ ] ElasticSearchX::Model be re-written or replaced (Search::ESX::Model?)
- [ ] ???
